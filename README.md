# personal-webpage
Website I created November 2020 as a means to showcase what I am working on to potential employers, as well as have contact information about me.
I created this site originally using HTML/CSS/JS but over time slowly added PHP (not using now), and later on switched to using Azure for deployment, and
ASP.NET Core for development. This is a major upgrade to using Vim and my old college Linux access for deployment. If you are interested in seeing the site, the link
